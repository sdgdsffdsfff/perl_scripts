class barrier(object):
    """ Multi-machine barrier support

    Provides multi-machine barrier mechanism.  Execution
    stopping until all members arrive at the barrier.

    When a barrier is forming the master node (first in sort
    order) in the set accepts connections from each member
    of the set.     As they arrive they indicate the barrier
    they are joining and their identifier (their hostname
    or IP address and optional tag).  They are then asked
    to wait.  When all members are present the master node
    then checks that each member is still responding via a
    ping/pong exchange.     If this is successful then everyone
    has checked in at the barrier.  We then tell everyone
    they may continue via a rlse message.

    Where the master is not the first to reach the barrier
    the client connects will fail.  Client will retry until
    they either succeed in connecting to master or the overal
    timeout is exceeded.

    As an example here is the exchange for a three node
    barrier called 'TAG'

      MASTER                        CLIENT1         CLIENT2
        <-------------TAG C1-------------
        --------------wait-------------->
                      [...]
        <-------------TAG C2-----------------------------
        --------------wait------------------------------>
                      [...]
        --------------ping-------------->
        <-------------pong---------------
        --------------ping------------------------------>
        <-------------pong-------------------------------
                ----- BARRIER conditions MET -----
        --------------rlse-------------->
        --------------rlse------------------------------>

    Note that once the last client has responded to pong the
    barrier is implicitly deemed satisifed, they have all
    acknowledged their presence.  If we fail to send any
    of the rlse messages the barrier is still a success,
    the failed host has effectively broken 'right at the
    beginning' of the post barrier execution window.

    In addition, there is another rendezvous, that makes each slave a server
    and the master a client. The connection process and usage is still the
    same but allows barriers from machines that only have a one-way
    connection initiation. This is called rendezvous_servers.

    For example:
        if ME == SERVER:
            server start

        b = job.barrier(ME, 'server-up', 120)
        b.rendezvous(CLIENT, SERVER)

        if ME == CLIENT:
            client run

        b = job.barrier(ME, 'test-complete', 3600)
        b.rendezvous(CLIENT, SERVER)

        if ME == SERVER:
            server stop


    Any client can also request an abort of the job by setting
    abort=True in the rendezvous arguments.
